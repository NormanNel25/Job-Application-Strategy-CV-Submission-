># Job-Application-Strategy-CV-Submission-

I initially thought that its as simple as crafting a CV and submitting it not realizing that employers, hiring managers and recruiters want to see your lifes work on it.
This lead to many rejection emails even though I meet all the requirements my CV I discovered was not up to par with their expectations and not detailed enough to make a decision to hire me for their roles.
There are too many to count rejection letters from employers but it only takes one to hire you. It was not until a full year after I was hired as a trainee technician that I started getting calls from previous applications. With the progress I was making and the reviews I am getting on the company website I got hits back.
